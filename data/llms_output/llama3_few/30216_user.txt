Based on the feature importances, we can see that sedentary minutes and minutes below zone 1 have significant negative contributions to the user's well-being, indicating a strong correlation between physical activity levels and positive well-being. On the other hand, exertion points, sleep points, and step goal all have moderate positive contributions, suggesting that these factors also play an important role in determining the user's overall well-being. The feature importances provide valuable insights into which features are most influential in predicting the user's well-being, allowing for targeted interventions to improve their mental health.
