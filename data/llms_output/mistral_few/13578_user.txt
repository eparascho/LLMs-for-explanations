Based on the given feature importances, it appears that the number of minutes below zone 1 (minutes\_below\_zone\_1) has a relatively high impact on the user's positive well-being. This is indicated by its positive value and significant magnitude compared to other features. In contrast, sedentary_minutes have a negative impact on well-being, which is also evident from its large negative value. The exertion\_points and sleep\_points variables also contribute positively to the user's well-being. The step\_goal variable has a negligible impact as indicated by its small magnitude and negative sign. Altogether, these findings suggest that users who spend more time below their target heart rate zone (zone 1) and have higher exertion points and sleep points are likely to report positive well-being.
