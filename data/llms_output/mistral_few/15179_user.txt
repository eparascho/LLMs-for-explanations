Sedentary minutes and minutes below zone 1 have the most significant negative impact on this user's well-being, while exertion points and lightly active minutes have a positive influence. The other features, such as steps, exercises, exercise duration, altitude, moderately active minutes, sleep points, sleep duration, calories, and minutes in zone 2 and zone 3, have comparatively smaller impact on the user's well-being based on these data.
