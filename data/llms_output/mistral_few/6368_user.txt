Based on the feature importances from both users' data and considering the negative well-being for one user (Friday at 23 o'clock), we can conclude that excessive sedentary behavior negatively affects an individual's well-being. While positive factors like minutes below zone 1, sleep points, and light activity minutes contribute positively to well-being. In the case of User 1 and User 2, their positive well-being was influenced by less time spent in sedentary activities, more minutes below zone 1, and sufficient sleep duration. However, it is important to remember that this analysis only provides a general understanding of the relationship between these factors and an individual's well-being. Further research would be required to validate and expand upon these findings.
