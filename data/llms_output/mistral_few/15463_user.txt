These are the feature importances for a user with positive well-being on Wednesday at 9 o'clock. The sedentary minutes and minutes below zone 1 have the highest absolute values, indicating that they have the most significant impact on this user's well-being. The exertion points, sleep points, lightly active minutes, exercises, exercise duration, minutes in zone 1, very active minutes, altitude, moderately active minutes, and sedentary minutes also have some impact, but their contributions are smaller than those of the top two features.
