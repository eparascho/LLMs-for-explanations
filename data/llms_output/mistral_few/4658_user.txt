Based on the given data, the most important features that affect a user's well-being are minutes below zone 1 and sedentary minutes. The more time a user spends below their target heart rate zone (minutes below zone 1) and sedentary (sedentary minutes), the more negative impact it has on their well-being. In contrast, exertion points and steps have a positive effect on well-being. However, in this particular case, the user with negative well-being had a high number of sedentary minutes but also spent very little time below zone 1 or exercising. Therefore, it's essential to note that these findings are specific to this dataset and may not generalize to other populations or contexts. It's always recommended to consult healthcare professionals for personalized wellness advice.
