The feature importances suggest that the user with negative well-being has a significantly higher number of sedentary minutes compared to the users with positive well-being. In contrast, the users with positive well-being have a relatively larger proportion of time spent in light and moderately active zones, as indicated by the positive values for minutes_in_zone_1 and moderately_active_minutes. The exertion_points and sleep_points also seem to be less important in predicting negative well-being, but this could be due to the specific data used or the model architecture.
