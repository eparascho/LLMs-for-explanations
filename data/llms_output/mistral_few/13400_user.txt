The feature importances suggest that the number of minutes below the zone 1 (minutes_below_zone_1) has a significant positive effect on the user's well-being, followed by lightly active minutes (lightly_active_minutes), exertion points (exertion_points), and sleep points (sleep_points). The step goal (step_goal) has a negative impact, meaning that having no step goal might be beneficial for this user. The other features, such as altitude, minutes in zone 1, minutes in zone 2, minutes in zone 3, steps, exercises, exercise duration, and calories, have relatively small impacts on the user's well-being according to the given data.
