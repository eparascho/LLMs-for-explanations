The feature importances indicate that the amount of time spent in sedentary minutes has the highest negative impact on well-being, followed closely by the amount of time spent below the target heart rate zone (minutes_below_zone_1). This suggests that staying active and avoiding long periods of sitting or being inactive is important for positive well-being. The other features, such as exertion points, steps taken, and time spent in various heart rate zones, have smaller but still significant impacts on well-being. The exact magnitude and sign of these impacts can vary between individuals based on their personal fitness levels, preferences, and other factors. Therefore, it is essential to pay attention to all the features, not just the two with the largest impacts, when assessing overall well-being.
