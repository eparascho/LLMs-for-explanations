The user with negative well-being on Sunday at 4 o'clock has a high sedentary time of around 1,440 minutes compared to the other users. This is reflected in the large negative importance value (-0.487139526963552) for this feature. The user also spends significantly less time below their zone 1 (only 52.763 minutes) and has no exertion points, steps, or active minutes. This is reflected in the positive importance values of 'minutes_below_zone_1' and the negative importance values for 'exertion_points', 'steps', and 'active_minutes'. The user also does not report any exercises or exercise durations. The small positive importance value for 'sleep_points' suggests that this user gets an adequate amount of sleep but still has negative well-being overall.
