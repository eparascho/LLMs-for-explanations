This user's high number of lightly active minutes and moderate exertion points contribute to their positive well-being classification, as these features are more strongly associated with good well-being according to the feature importances. Despite having a relatively long duration below the ideal zone 1, the large number of light and moderately active minutes counteract this negative factor. The user's exertion points also play a role in their positive classification, although its impact is smaller compared to the other features. Sleep points are another important factor for good well-being, which the user has an adequate amount of based on the feature importances.
