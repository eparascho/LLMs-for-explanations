Based on the feature importance computed, it appears that a user with low exertion points, high number of minutes spent in Zone 1 (within the recommended activity level), and minimal sedentary time contributes to positive well-being. In this case, the user's low exertion points (27.0) and relatively high minutes in Zone 1 (83.0) suggest they were engaged in moderate-intensity activities throughout their hour. Additionally, their short sedentary time (713.0 minutes) indicates a lack of prolonged sitting or inactivity, contributing to positive well-being. These factors outweigh the negative impact of having fewer steps than goal and minimal very active minutes, as well as the user's low calories burned during that hour. Overall, the user's behavior aligns with the characteristics typically associated with positive well-being according to our clustering algorithm.
