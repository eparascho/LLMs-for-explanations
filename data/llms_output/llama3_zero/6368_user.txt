The user's data on Friday at 23 o'clock indicates a low level of physical activity, as evident from the minimal time spent in zone 1 (156 minutes) and the overall sedentary behavior (1440 minutes). The exertion points also suggest that the user did not engage in intense physical activity. The sleep points are relatively high, indicating a potentially good night's sleep. However, these factors combined suggest that the user had negative well-being, as their data does not indicate any significant physical or mental activity that would contribute to positive well-being.
