Based on the feature importance, it seems that the user's high exertion points (16,607) and sedentary behavior (1440 minutes) are contributing factors to their negative well-being. The low step goal of 0.0 may also indicate a lack of physical activity, which is consistent with the clustering result. Additionally, the low calories burned at 0.9 suggests that the user's daily energy expenditure is relatively low, which might be related to their negative well-being.
