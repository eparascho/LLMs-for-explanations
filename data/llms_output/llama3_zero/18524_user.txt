Based on the feature importance, it appears that the user's exertion points (25.299) and step count (430.3) are contributing to their clustering in the negative well-being cluster. Although they have some minutes spent in zone 1, which is a moderate-intensity exercise zone, the overall amount of time spent in lower intensity zones (zone 1 and below) suggests that the user may not be engaging in enough physical activity to positively impact their well-being. The relatively low sleep points (19.607) also suggest that the user may not have gotten sufficient rest, which could further contribute to negative well-being.
