Based on the feature importance computed, the high levels of exertion points (-0.5), minutes below zone 1 (-0.8), sedentary minutes (-0.9), and low exercise count (-1.0) are contributing to this user's negative well-being classification at Tuesday, 16:00. The lack of time spent in active zones (0.2 minutes in Zone 1, 0.0 minutes in Zones 2 and 3) and insufficient exercise duration also support the negative well-being assessment. Low sleep points (-0.2) further contribute to this result. In contrast, positive well-being is associated with lower levels of exertion points, more time spent in active zones, regular exercise, sufficient sleep, and a balanced distribution of sedentary and active minutes throughout the day.
