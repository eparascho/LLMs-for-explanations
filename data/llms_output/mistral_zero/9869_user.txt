Based on the feature importance computed, we can see that having a high number of minutes below zone 1 (706 minutes) and a low number of exercises (-1.2) are the main reasons why this user has negative well-being. These features had large negative impacts on the clustering result, indicating that they contribute significantly to negative well-being as categorized by our algorithm. The lack of steps and activity in higher intensity zones (0 steps, 0 minutes in zone 1, 2, or 3), combined with a high number of sedentary minutes (875) also support this conclusion.
