The user's high amount of time spent in Zone 1 (positive activity) and low amount of time below Zone 1 (negative activity), along with a moderate number of steps, contribute to the positive well-being result. Although this user had fewer minutes lightly active compared to sedentary minutes, the large difference between negative and positive activity levels outweighed this factor. Additionally, the user's exertion points were relatively low, which also supported their positive well-being classification.
