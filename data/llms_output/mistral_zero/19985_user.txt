Based on the feature importance, a user with high values of minutes below zone 1 (inactive time) and sedentary minutes, coupled with low values of steps, minutes in active zones (zone 1, zone 2), and exertion points, is more likely to be categorized as having negative well-being. In this case, the user on Sunday at 17 o'clock has a high value for minutes below zone 1 (640.09 minutes) and sedentary minutes (1440.0), and low values for steps (419.475), minutes in active zones (zero), and exertion points (16.607). These features suggest that the user has been inactive for extended periods, which may contribute to negative well-being.
