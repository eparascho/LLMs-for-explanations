The user's high exertion points (25.299) and a large amount of time spent below zone 1 (462.081 minutes) indicate they were likely to have been physically active but not reaching recommended activity levels, which could lead to negative well-being. Additionally, the user had very few minutes in zone 2 or zone 3, suggesting little variation in their activity throughout the day. The low number of steps (576.217) and lack of time spent in moderately or vigorously active zones further support this interpretation. These features align with the clustering result that categorized this user as having negative well-being.
