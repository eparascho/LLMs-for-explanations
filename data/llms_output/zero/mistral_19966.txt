User response:
Based on the feature importance computed, we can see that the user's extended periods below their target heart rate zone (Zone 1) and time spent in Zone 2 contribute to negative well-being. This user had a total of 640.09 minutes below Zone 1 and only 18.876 minutes in Zone 2 on Saturday at 22 o'clock. Additionally, they had a low number of calories burned, which could also indicate a lack of physical activity contributing to negative well-being.
