User response: Based on the feature importance computed, the user's high number of calories burned and low minutes below zone 1 indicate positive well-being. These features are strongly associated with a healthy lifestyle, as regular physical activity and consuming an adequate amount of calories contribute to overall health. While the exertion points and minutes in zone 2 were not as influential, having a moderate level of these factors also suggests good well-being. The low step count and lack of exercises did not significantly impact the clustering result for this user.
