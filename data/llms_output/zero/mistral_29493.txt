 Developer response:{"exertion points": 0.2, "steps": 0.01, "minutes below zone 1": 0.5, "minutes in zone 1": -0.5, "sedentary minutes": 0.8}

User response: Based on the feature importance, the high number of minutes spent below the recommended activity zones (0.5) and a large amount of sedentary time (0.8) are significant factors contributing to this user's negative well-being classification at 1 o'clock on Monday. Despite having a relatively low exertion point value and taking very few steps, these two features indicate a lack of engagement in physical activity throughout the hour.
