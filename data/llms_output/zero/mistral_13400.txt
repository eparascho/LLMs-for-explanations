User response: The user on Friday at 22 o'clock, despite having a relatively low number of exertion points (32.0), spent most of their time in the zone of positive well-being (Zone 1, 978.0 minutes) and had a considerable amount of lightly active minutes (220.0). These two features have strong positive impact on well-being based on the feature importance computed from the clustering results. Additionally, they spent minimal time below Zone 1, which indicates good physical activity levels. The negative factors such as sedentary minutes (987.0) and sleep duration (0.0) had less impact in determining this user's positive well-being in this particular hour compared to their other positive features.
