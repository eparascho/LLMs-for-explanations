 Developer response: {"exertion_points": -0.1, "steps": 0.5, "minutes_below_zone_1": -1.5, "minutes_in_zone_1": 1.5, "minutes_lightly_active": 2.5, "minutes_sedentary": -8.5}

User response: The user's high number of minutes in zone 1 (positive energy expenditure) and relatively low minutes below zone 1 (low intensity) contribute positively to their well-being. Additionally, a moderate amount of lightly active minutes further supports this categorization as positive well-being. Despite having fewer steps than average, the other features indicate that the user's energy levels were sufficient, which explains why they have been categorized into the positive well-being cluster.
