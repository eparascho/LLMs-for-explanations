User response:
This user's positive well-being can be attributed to a balanced physical activity level. The feature importance suggests that the number of sedentary minutes (-0.257) and minutes below zone 1 (0.191) are key contributors to their well-being, indicating a mix of rest and moderate physical activity. Additionally, the user has achieved their step goal of 0 steps, which is likely due to the moderate amount of lightly active minutes (0.156). The relatively high exertion points (0.115) also support this conclusion. On the other hand, the sleep points (0.089) and calories (0.002) seem less influential in determining their well-being.
