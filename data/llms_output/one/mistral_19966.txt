User response: The user at Saturday 22 o'clock has a high number of minutes below the target heart rate zone 1 (-0.3524), and a large sedentary time (-0.3153). These features have significant negative impacts on well-being, explained by the local LimeXAI method as having feature importances of -0.3524 and -0.3153 respectively. In contrast, exertion points (0.1579) and steps (-0.0368), which are typically associated with positive well-being, have relatively small effects in this case. Since the negative impacts of minutes below zone 1 and sedentary time outweigh the positive impact from exertion points and steps, this user is categorized into the negative well-being cluster.
