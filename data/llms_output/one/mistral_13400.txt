 Based on the provided feature importances, the user's high number of "lightly_active_minutes" (0.220) and "sedentary_minutes" (0.987) do not significantly contribute to negative well-being as their feature importance values are relatively small in comparison to the positive features. Instead, a larger influence on positive well-being comes from having "steps" (277.144), which is positively important as indicated by its slight feature importance value of 0.006. Although the user has a considerable amount of time "below zone 1" (978.0 minutes), this feature does not heavily impact well-being negatively due to its smaller feature importance value (-0.006). Therefore, despite having fewer positive features compared to the example with positive well-being, this user's relatively high number of steps and lower amount of sedentary time contribute positively to their overall well-being.
