User response:
The user on Wednesday at 0 o'clock has negative well-being because the model primarily considers the sedentary minutes, which are extremely high (1440.0), to be a strong indicator of negative well-being. This is further supported by the low step goal (0.0) and the fact that there are no exercises or lightly active minutes recorded. The model also takes into account the exertion points, sleep points, and altitude, but these features have relatively low importance in this case.
