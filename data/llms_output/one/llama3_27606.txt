User response:
This user's negative well-being can be attributed to their high sedentary minutes (1285), which indicates a lack of physical activity. This feature has the highest importance score, indicating its significant impact on the clustering result. Additionally, their low step goal (0) suggests that they are not setting realistic goals for themselves, and their low altitude (10) may indicate a lack of engagement in physical activities. These factors combined contribute to their classification as having negative well-being.
