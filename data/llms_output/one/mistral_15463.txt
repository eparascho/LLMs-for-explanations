User response: The user on Wednesday at 9 o'clock has a high number of lightly active minutes and exertion points, which are positive contributors to their well-being, according to the feature importances. Additionally, they have fewer minutes below zone 1 compared to the user in the example with negative well-being. The number of steps taken by this user is negligible but has a slight negative impact on their well-being. Despite having more sedentary minutes than the user with positive well-being, it seems that other factors such as their high levels of lightly active minutes and exertion points have a stronger influence on their overall well-being, leading to them being categorized in the positive cluster.
