User response: The user on Thursday at 1pm with a high exertion_points value and relatively low sedentary_minutes, along with positive minutes_in_zone_1, contributed positively to their well-being classification. Despite having zero steps and no active minutes in other zones, the positive contribution of exertion_points and minutes_in_zone_1 outweighed the negative impact from sedentary_minutes. Additionally, a moderate number of lightly_active_minutes and a decent sleep_points value supported their positive well-being classification.
