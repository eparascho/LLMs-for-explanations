User response: Despite having a relatively high exertion point value and a significant amount of time spent below the ideal heart rate zone, this user's positive well-being is likely due to their considerable amount of light activity minutes and sleep points. The large number of lightly active minutes and sufficient sleep points contribute positively to their overall well-being. Although they have fewer steps than the previous example, the presence of exercises and exercise duration could also be contributing factors.
