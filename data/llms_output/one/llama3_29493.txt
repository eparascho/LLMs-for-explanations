User response:
The user on Monday at 1 o'clock with negative well-being has high sedentary minutes (1440) which is a strong indicator of negative well-being. Additionally, the exertion points are moderate (25.299), indicating some physical activity, but not enough to counterbalance the high sedentary time. The step goal is actually 0, implying that the user is far from achieving their daily step target, which might also contribute to their negative well-being.
