User response:
The user on Sunday at 17 o'clock has negative well-being due to the high sedentary minutes (1440) and low exertion points (16.607), indicating a lack of physical activity and energy. Additionally, the low sleep points (11.107) suggest poor sleep quality, which may also contribute to their negative well-being. The feature importance suggests that these factors have a strong influence on the clustering result, with sedentary minutes being the most important feature in explaining why this user has negative well-being.
