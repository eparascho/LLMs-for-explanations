User response:
Based on the feature importances, we can see that sedentary minutes have a strong negative impact (-0.257) and minutes below zone 1 have a positive impact (0.191). The user on Sunday at 9 o'clock has 604 sedentary minutes and 916 minutes below zone 1. Despite having high exertion points, the dominant feature of sedentary minutes pushes them towards negative well-being. However, their low step goal and high altitude suggest that they might be engaging in some physical activity, which could counterbalance the negative impact of sedentary minutes.
