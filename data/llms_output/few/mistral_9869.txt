The most important feature for positive well-being is "minutes below zone 1", which has a high positive coefficient, indicating that spending more time in this zone contributes to better well-being. In contrast, the most important feature for negative well-being is "sedentary minutes", which has a large negative coefficient. This suggests that spending longer periods of time being sedentary is detrimental to well-being. The other features have smaller coefficients and do not significantly contribute to the difference between positive and negative well-being in this case.
