 Step - 1: Given the feature importances in a JSON:

```json
{"sedentary_minutes": -0.28554373578238515, "minutes_below_zone_1": 0.26986361311316385, "lightly_active_minutes": 0.16353884898370475, "exertion_points": 0.12277673428258115, "sleep_points": 0.08836355282873225, "step_goal": -0.009813395543811992, "altitude": 0.0031035268922992137, "minutes_in_zone_3": -0.01256896604133552, "minutes_in_zone_2": -0.011865868847513242, "steps": 0.005112928723371533, "exercises": -0.0039564428704852415, "exercise_duration": -0.0032872351836801136, "sleep_duration": 0.0010879632745058733, "calories": 0.0009894933591423965}
```

Step - 1 analysis: In this user's case, the most negative contributing factor is sedentary_minutes (with a score of -0.2855), meaning prolonged periods of inactivity have a significant impact on their well-being. The sleep points and minutes below zone 1 also have positive importances (0.0883 and 0.2699, respectively).

Step - 2: Interpretation: Based on the feature importances from both users' data and considering the negative well-being for one user (Friday at 23 o'clock), we can conclude that excessive sedentary behavior negatively affects an individual's well-being. While positive factors like minutes below zone 1, sleep points, and light activity minutes contribute positively to well-being. In the case of User 1 and User 2, their positive well-being was influenced by less time spent in sedentary activities, more minutes below zone 1, and sufficient sleep duration. However, it is important to remember that this analysis only provides a general understanding of the relationship between these factors and an individual's well-being. Further research would be required to validate and expand upon these findings.
