User response:
Based on the feature importances, we can see that for all three users, sedentary minutes have a negative impact on their well-being, while minutes below zone 1 and lightly active minutes have a positive impact. This suggests that engaging in physical activity and reducing sedentary behavior may be important factors in maintaining positive well-being. Additionally, exertion points and sleep points also appear to have a positive impact on well-being. Overall, these findings suggest that promoting physical activity and healthy lifestyle habits may be an effective way to improve mental health and well-being.
