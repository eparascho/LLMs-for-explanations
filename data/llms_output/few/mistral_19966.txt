 Step - 1: Given the feature importances in a JSON:

```json
{"sedentary_minutes": -0.4568237584115812, "minutes_below_zone_1": 0.33249893818591336, "lightly_active_minutes": 0.10833274925362413, "exertion_points": 0.0851555845481994, "sleep_points": 0.04114231239158766, "step_goal": -0.007856877156138523, "altitude": 0.003549882381148737, "minutes_in_zone_3": -0.007825331167577785, "minutes_in_zone_2": -0.00778485935381522, "steps": 0.001241875224668467, "exercises": -0.011318815229783337, "exercise_duration": -0.006731238618475315, "calories": 0.001137828453882394}
```

Step - 2: Interpretation of the feature importances:

The feature importances suggest that the user with negative well-being has a significantly higher number of sedentary minutes compared to the users with positive well-being. In contrast, the users with positive well-being have a relatively larger proportion of time spent in light and moderately active zones, as indicated by the positive values for minutes_in_zone_1 and moderately_active_minutes. The exertion_points and sleep_points also seem to be less important in predicting negative well-being, but this could be due to the specific data used or the model architecture.

It is important to note that these feature importances are based on a particular machine learning model and dataset, so their interpretation should be taken with caution. Further analysis and validation are necessary before drawing definitive conclusions.
