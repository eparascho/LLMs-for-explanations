User response:
Based on the feature importances, we can see that sedentary minutes have a significant negative impact on well-being, while minutes below zone 1 and lightly active minutes have positive impacts. The exertion points, sleep points, and step goal also contribute positively to well-being. On the other hand, very active minutes and altitude have relatively smaller impacts. Overall, these factors suggest that having more sedentary time may be detrimental to one's well-being, while engaging in physical activities and getting some rest can have positive effects.
