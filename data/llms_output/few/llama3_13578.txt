User response:
Based on the feature importance, it appears that the clustering algorithm primarily considers sedentary minutes, minutes below zone 1, and lightly active minutes when determining a user's well-being as positive. These features suggest that the user has been engaging in less intense physical activity, which may indicate a sense of relaxation and calmness. The fact that exertion points also play a role in the algorithm suggests that users who experience increased energy expenditure are more likely to have positive well-being.
