User response:
Based on the feature importances, it's clear that this user's positive well-being is primarily driven by their exertion points, with a moderate contribution from sedentary minutes and minutes below zone 1. The lightly active minutes also play a significant role in determining their well-being. On the other hand, very active minutes and sleep duration have relatively smaller effects on their overall well-being.
