Based on the feature importance computed for the user on Saturday at 7 o'clock, we can see that sedentary minutes and minutes below zone 1 are important features in determining positive well-being. For this new user on Friday at 22 o'clock, we observe that they have a high number of sedentary minutes (987) which is consistent with the importance of sedentary minutes in predicting positive well-being. Additionally, their minutes below zone 1 (978) are also relatively high, indicating that they may not be engaging in as much physical activity as desired. Given these features and their values, it's likely that this user has positive well-being due to a balance between rest and minimal physical activity. The actual values for steps (277), altitude (10), and sleep points (16) also support this conclusion.
