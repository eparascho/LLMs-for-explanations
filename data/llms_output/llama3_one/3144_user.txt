For the user on Friday at 11 o'clock, who has 25.299 exertion points, we can infer that their positive well-being is due to a combination of factors. The feature importance suggests that having fewer sedentary minutes (71.0) and more lightly active minutes (170.0) contributed positively to their well-being. Additionally, the fact that they have 10 very active minutes and only 731 sedentary minutes indicates that they were actively moving around during this time. These factors, along with the relatively high sleep points (19.607), likely contributed to their positive well-being.
