""Likely to be a key factor"" introduces an uncertainty whose source is uncertain (pun intended); it can make the user feel a bit lost. This can be related to the lack of an explicit assessment of the confidence on the classification or the explanation itself!  (Who would explain the explanation?). This happens in LIME as well. Although at first sight a textual explanation should be more user-friendly, this can disguise unclear/uncertain/unnecessary/irrelevant information. It can also be longer to process, and it lends itself to a combination with some very simple form of graphics to reinforce or complement the text. Overall, it looks ""unconvincing"", more like an excuse than an useful explanation. ","4","I guess I understood the idea of what you might be interested in.

Clear enough but not thoroughly explained. If the goal was a broader audience it could have been better. If it was intended for specific audiences and arrived to me by accident then this criticism can be dismissed."

Provides more information, that maybe useful if you want to go more in depth.

Easy to understand and feels human-like. Provides an explanation that may be helpful.
Cons:
Lacks depth in information, and the possibilities that another factory could be equally important.","3","Before the first question, explaining what exactly is the point behind the graphs could be more clear."
