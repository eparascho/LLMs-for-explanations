If this is the case, the outputs are pretty different. Why Llama3 is saying something about 4 o'clock? And why it seems to be giving more importance to some factors, that are not the most relevant factors shown by Lime?

In addition, most of the scores are hard to interpret or differentiate: exciting/boring, usual/cutting edge...? I find hard to evaluate in the context of the questionaire and the answers can be pretty random. "
