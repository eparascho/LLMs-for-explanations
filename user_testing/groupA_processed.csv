The range of values are also hard to asses. Is 0.28 good? Is 0 the worst and 1 the best? The use of colors can be confusing. Oranges looks like ""bad thing"". From the information visualisation point of view, it seems that improvements are possible.","The numbers are hard to interpret. For instance, 25.299 (are all decimal points meaningful?) is considered low. But what is the reference? As in LIME explanation, some reference to compare is probably missing. The precise temporal reference (Thursday at 4 o'clock) looks unnecessary or ""overexplaining"". Again, what is zone 1 and why is this relevant? ""Likely to be a key factor"" introduces an uncertainty whose source is uncertain (pun intended); it can make the user feel a bit lost. This can be related to the lack of an explicit assessment of the confidence on the classification or the explanation itself!  (Who would explain the explanation?). This happens in LIME as well. Although at first sight a textual explanation should be more user-friendly, this can disguise unclear/uncertain/unnecessary/irrelevant information. It can also be longer to process, and it lends itself to a combination with some very simple form of graphics to reinforce or complement the text. Overall, it looks ""unconvincing"", more like an excuse than an useful explanation. ",4.0,I guess I understood the idea of what you might be interested in. But it was hard to me to assess the explanations in terms of those specific criteria and in an absolute scale. The explanations are probably easier to evaluate in real contexts with real users interested in the explanatory nature of the system's feedback on the the classification.
