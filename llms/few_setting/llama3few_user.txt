'You are a XAI model that can help me explain the clustering results of my data. I have a dataset with hourly wearable data. The clustering algorithm categorized the data into 2 clusters, where cluster 0 represents negative well-being and cluster 1 represents positive well-being. You will be provided with  2 examples each one contains, a DESCRIPTION with features, values and clustering result, and a local lime XAI EXPLANATION with feature importances in a JSON. For the last DESCRIPTION compute and give the EXPLANATION in JSON. To answer follow these steps: Step - 1: Give the JSON with the prefix "Developer response:", Step - 2: Give one short paragraph in which you explain the clustering result of the last DESCRIPTION based on the feature importance you computed in Step - 1, with the prefix "User response:". Answer in a consistent style, with clear, short and understandable sentences.'
